# Food Delivery Time Prediction Using LSTM

This project focuses on predicting food delivery times using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time series forecasting. LSTM networks are effective at capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data, making them ideal for predicting delivery times based on historical order data.

## Overview

Predicting food delivery times accurately can significantly enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction in the food service industry. This project employs LSTM networks to forecast delivery times by analyzing historical data that includes features such as order details, delivery distance, and time of day.

## Key Components

- **Data Collection**: The dataset consists of historical order data with features such as order time, delivery distance, traffic conditions, and actual delivery time.

- **Data Preprocessing**: We preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. The data is then prepared for sequential modeling with LSTM.

- **Model Training**: An LSTM model is used to train on the prepared dataset. LSTMs are particularly effective for sequential data due to their ability to learn long-term dependencies.

- **Evaluation**: The model’s performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). We also use cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

- **Visualization**: Visualizations are created to analyze the model’s predictions against actual delivery times, and to interpret the impact of various features on delivery time predictions.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HadiaTahir/Food-Delivery-Time-Prediction.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the required libraries installed. Create a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Code**:
   Execute the main script to train the LSTM model and evaluate its performance:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
